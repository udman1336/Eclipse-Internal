# Eclipse-Internal 🚀

Welcome to the **Eclipse-Internal** repository!  
This repository contains an internal source and resources for Eclipse Version 3.6. Feel free to use this to create cheats or explore the SDK.

THIS IS NOT FOR CURRENT FORTNITE, THIS IS FOR OG FORTNITE

---

> **Why This Exists:**  
> I don't appreciate how Eclipse operates, especially their decision to leak Project Rewind's Launcher source.  
> So, here's a gift to the community. Enjoy!
